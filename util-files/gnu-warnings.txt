- -Wmissing-declarations
- -Wmissing-variable-declarations (clang-specific)

f5:
- -Wstrict-prototypes

f7:
- -Wpedantic (GCC only, Clang doesn't allow nested functions at all)

l5:
- -Wdeclaration-after-statement (GCC only, Clang accepts it but doesn't do anything)

c3:
- -Dgoto='_Static_assert(0, "do not use goto")' (will work on any compiler with something like -D, even if they don't support _Static_assert, since it will fail to compile anyway)

command line for all (GCC):

- CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Wmissing-declarations -Wstrict-prototypes -Wpedantic -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Dgoto='_Static_assert(0, \"do not use goto\")'" (for use in Make invocation)
