O- Files organization
O1: Contents of the delivery folder: Will do this later, maybe premade .gitignore to help and/or a script that checks the content of the git repo itself
O2: File extensions: Might be able to make script for this, will see later
O3: File coherence: Will need custom thingy
O4: Naming files and folders: Could possibly flag short filenames, easy to flag non-snake_case though

G- Global scope
G1: File header: Easy to flag for
G2: Seperatation of functions: Easy to flag for
G3: Indentation of pre-processor directives: Will probably need custom check, shouldn't be too hard to make though
G4: Global variables: clang-tidy: cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers, cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
G5: Static: gcc/clang: -Wmissing-prototypes and clang-tidy: clang-diagnostic-missing-prototypes

F- Functions
F1: Coherence of functions: Probably can't be done automatically
F2: Naming functions: For the verb part, could do such a check but it would probably be in some strident category. Checking for snake_case should be easy enough
