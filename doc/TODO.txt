L1: currently have some regexes for first and second line (( (?:[+\-*\/%&|\^]|<<|>>)?= |while|if|switch).* (?:[+\-*\/%&|\^]|<<|>>)?= |;.*;), regex might be possible for third line, 4th line should be done by clang-format, idk about 5th line
L2-L4: done in clang-format, TODO stub
L5: done in gcc, TODO stub
L6: TODO something in the tool idk
V1: F2 partially does this, TODO make a modified version that checks all identifiers and not just functions, along with checking typedefs for _t and macros/global constants/enums for UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
V2: unimplementable, TODO stub
V3: done in clang-format, TODO stub
C1: done in clang-tidy (not perfectly but it mostly works), TODO stub
C2: undoable in clang-tidy/clang-format as far as I can see, maybe investigate more tools but rn this just seems undoable (it certainly is in the tool). TODO stub
C3: done in GNU compilers with a define and consequently in clang-tidy (if configuring the compile_commands with the GNU compiler command). TODO stub
A1: done in clang-tidy, TODO stub
A2: TODO
H1-H3: TODO

Make it so that stuff depending on Git can still work even when `--directory` is not set to the root of the git repository, probably just change the file list method
Use forward declares for string/vector if I can find out how to handle that with libstdc++/libc++
Move git::index::file_list to file_utils
Maybe make a more comprehensive testsuite
